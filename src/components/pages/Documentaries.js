                autobiographical documentary film. Me is a selection of
                different cinematic expressions by filmmakers whose study of
                themselves is both a journey into their own private history as
                well as an artistic exploration. The program consists of around
                20 documentaries, both classics and premieres, from different
                regions of Africa and the diaspora, made by both a new
                generation of filmmakers as well as established auteurs. Many of
                the filmmakers will be discussing their films at the festival.
